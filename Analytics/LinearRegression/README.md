# Linear Regression Assumptions 

I analyze this dataset based on some assumptions of linear regression.

1. Linear relationship between the features and target - Linear regression requires the relationship between the independent and dependent variables to be linear. Linearity can be checked with the scatter plot and Pearson Correlation.

2. No Multicollinearity - Linear regression assumes that the independent variables are not highly correlated with each other. This assumption is tested using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) values.

3. Homoscedasticity – This assumption states that the variance of errors is similar across the values of the independent variables. A plot of standardized residuals versus predicted values can show whether points are equally distributed across all values of the independent variables.

4. Normal distribution of errors – Linear regression assumes that the residuals are normally distributed.
