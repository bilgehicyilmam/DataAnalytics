# HR Analytics Case Study

A large company named XYZ employs around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company.
In this study, I model the probability of attrition using logistic regression to understand what changes the management should make to their workplace,
in order to ensure most of their employees to stay.
