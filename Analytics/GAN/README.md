# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network

This notebook demonstrates how to generate images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN).

Since it takes a long time to train the algorithm, the number of epochs is 50 which is quite low for a deep learning algorithm to train.

However, the model can still separate the images.
